**Why This Project is Special:**

This project stands out by combining two powerful technologies:

*   **LlamaParse:**  We utilize **LlamaParse** for its exceptional ability to accurately extract text and tables from complex document formats. This ensures that no crucial information is missed during the analysis process.
*   **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp:** The core of the analysis is driven by **Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp model**. This cutting-edge model excels at reasoning and understanding complex text, allowing it to go beyond simple keyword matching and provide a deeper understanding of the RFP's content. Its ability to reason through the text is what makes the analysis truly insightful.

**Tech Stack:**

*   **Large Language Model:**  **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp** (via the `google.generativeai` library) -  The engine for intelligent analysis and reasoning.
*   **Document Parsing:** **LlamaParse** (via the `llama_parse` library) -  For robust and accurate extraction of text and tables from various document formats.
*   **Web Framework:** Streamlit (`streamlit`) - For creating the interactive user interface.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Pandas (`pandas`) - For efficient handling and analysis of tabular data.
*   **Environment Management:** `dotenv` - For managing API keys securely.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lesteroliver911/rfpanalyzer-gemini2-flashthinking]
    cd [rfpanalyzer-gemini2-flashthinking]
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up your API keys:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your Gemini API key and Llama Cloud API key to the `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY="YOUR_LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY"
        ```
    *   **Note:** You will need to obtain API keys for both Google Gemini and Llama Cloud to run this application.

5. **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

**Usage:**

1. **Upload your RFP document:** Use the file uploader in the sidebar to select your PDF, DOCX, or TXT file.
2. **View basic file information:** The sidebar will display the file name and size.
3. **Choose an analysis type:** Select from the available analysis buttons in the sidebar:
    *   **Analyze Full Content:** Provides a comprehensive overview of the entire document.
    *   **Analyze Requirements:** Focuses on extracting and analyzing the technical and business requirements.
    *   **Analyze Timeline:**  Identifies and analyzes key dates, deadlines, and milestones.
    *   **Analyze Compliance:**  Highlights compliance-related requirements and concerns.
4. **Review the analysis results:** The main panel will display the analysis generated by the AI.
5. **Explore extracted text and tables:** Use the expander sections to view the raw extracted text and any tables found in the document.
